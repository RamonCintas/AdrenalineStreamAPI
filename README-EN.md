# 💡 About the project

⚡ The AdrenalineStream API project is a JavaScript/NodeJS API implemented in Docker on AWS to extract relevant information from a website with content in RSS format. This application saves the data in a JSON file inside an S3 bucket, and allows the saved content to be consulted via an HTML page hosted on the AWS cloud.

![Flowchart of the AWS system, representing the interaction between services such as ECS, EC2, S3, ECR, with the user interacting with a static website](./assets/imagens/readme/sistema-en.svg)

<div align=“left”>

<details>
  <summary>Image Description</summary>
  This flowchart describes a system based on AWS:

- **Amazon ECS Cluster**: Manages the execution of containers.
- Amazon EC2 Instance\*\*: Hosts a virtual machine that runs a Docker environment.
- **Virtual Machine Docker**: Contains a container called “Back-end Server Container” that uses Node.js/Express.
- Back-end Server Container:
  - Processes RSS feeds and saves the data as JSON in Amazon S3.
  - Initializes an API that allows interactions with the system.
- Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)\*\*: Hosts Docker images that are used to create containers on EC2.
- Amazon S3 Bucket JSON: Stores JSON files generated by processing RSS feeds.
- **HTML Static Site in S3**: Allows the user to view JSON data and interact with the API.
- User: Interacts with the system via the static site in S3.

### Flow:

1. The container is deployed on the EC2 instance from Amazon ECR.
2. The application in the container processes RSS feeds and stores the data in JSON on Amazon S3.
3. The static site on S3:
   - Displays the extracted JSON data.
   - It offers options for the user to start the API or make new queries.
4. The initialized API returns JSON data to the site for display to the user.

The diagram uses a dark grey background, with elements arranged in colored boxes:

- Orange for AWS services.
- Blue for containers and backend.
- Green for the static site and user interactions.
- Connections and arrows in light gray.

# 🏗️ Architecture structure and interaction flow

**1. User interface (UI)**
- HTML page (hosted on S3): the static HTML page hosted in an S3 bucket serves as the user interface.
- Start API" button: This button triggers a request to the Node.js API to start the RSS extraction and JSON saving process.
- Get Data" button: This button accesses the JSON file stored in the S3 bucket and displays the data to the user.

**1.1 Structure of the Front-End**
- The front-end was organized using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** standard, with a view to separating responsibilities and ease of maintenance:
- **/controllers**: Contains the controllers that manage the interaction between the interface (view) and the data (model).
  - `feedController.js`: Controller for GET in the API, GET in S3 and JSON handling
- **/models**: Defines the models that represent the data manipulated by the application
  - `cardModel.js`: Model for the card data displayed in the interface
- **/views**: Responsible for rendering the data
  - `cardView.js`: Manages the rendering of cards
- **/utils**: Contains utility functions
  - `fetchUtil.js`: Function for making HTTP requests
  - `dataFormatter.js`: Function to return date in correct format

**2. Back-end API (Node.js/Express application)**
- Docker container: the Node.js application is containerized using Docker.
- AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS): the Docker container is managed by AWS ECS and runs on an EC2 instance.
- RSS feed extraction: On receiving the request from the "Start API" button, the API extracts data from the RSS feed and saves it in json and sends it to an S3 bucket.

**2.1 EndPoints:**
- **GET** `/transcribe-rss`:
- - This endpoint returns a transcribed RSS feed from the specified URL and sends the json to the S3 bucket.
- - Parameters: url (string) - The URL of the feed in question.
- - Request: GET /http://.../transcribe- rss?url=https://www.adrenaline.com.br/feed/
- **GET** `/https://.../rss-transcriptions/RSS- dados-coletados.json`:
- - This endpoint returns a json from the s3 bucket that was sent by the API.
- - Parameters: url (string) - The URL of the json in question.
- - Request: GET /https://.../rss-transcriptions/RSS- dados-coletados.json
- Sample Answer
- - [{"title": "title of the recorded test report", "description": "description text of the test report", "pubDate": "Weekday | Month | Year | Time"}, ...]

**3. AWS infrastructure**
- Amazon EC2 instance: hosts the Docker container managed by ECS.
- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR): stores Docker images for deployment.
- Amazon S3 bucket (data storage): the API saves the extracted data as a JSON file in this bucket.
- Amazon S3 bucket (static site): hosts the HTML page.

**4. Data flow:**
- User action: Start API: The user clicks "Start API" on the HTML page, sending a request to the Node.js API.
- RSS feed extraction: the API processes the RSS feed and saves the extracted data as a JSON file in the S3 bucket.
- User action: Fetch Data: the user clicks on "Fetch Data" and the HTML page fetches and displays the JSON data from the S3 bucket.
